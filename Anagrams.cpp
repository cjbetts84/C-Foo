"Problem 7 - Anagrams"
An anagram is a word or phrase that can be created from a second word 
or phrase by rearranging the letters. For example STEP is an anagram 
of PEST. Another way of stating this is that two phrases are anagrams 
of one another if they consist of exactly the same letters while 
ignoring spaces.

Write a program which accepts two phrases and reports whether they are 
anagrams. Your program needs to accept a pair of phrases and output a 
message indicating if the words or phrases are anagrams. Upper and 
lowercase letters are considered equivalent for this problem. Only 
letters (A to Z) are considered in determining if two phrases are anagrams.

Sample-

HAT  /  Cat - Not anagrams
dormitory / dirty room - anagrams
POLL / Pool - not anagrams
